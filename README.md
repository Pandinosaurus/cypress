*Synfire chain example running on the Spikey neuromorphic hardware system*

Cypress is a C++ Spiking Neural Network Simulation Framework. It allows to describe
and execute spiking neural networks on various simulation platforms directly in
C++ code. It provides a wrapper around PyNN, which allows to directly run networks
on the Human Brain Project (HBP) neuromorphic hardware systems. Cypress also allows
to transparently execute the networks remotely on the HBP Neuromorphic Compute Platform,
significantly shortening the time required when performing experiments.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hbp-unibi/cypress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hbp-unibi/cypress) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-doxygen-blue.svg)](https://hbp-unibi.github.io/cypress/index.html)

Building the sources
------------

Cypress requires a C++14 compliant compiler such as GCC 4.9 and CMake in version 3.0 (or later). In order to run Cypress applications on the Neuromorphic Compute Platform, they must be statically linked. To this end you should install the `glibc-static` and `libstdc++-static` libraries provided by your distribution. On Fedora you can install these using
```bash
sudo dnf install glibc-static libstdc++-static
```

The library ships with a simulator that supports all basic requirements (GeNN, see [github.io](http://genn-team.github.io/genn/) ). If you want to run simulations on NEST or SpiNNaker, you will need Python in version 2.7 and `pip` must be installed, as well as the PyPi package `pyNN`. You can install the latter using
```bash
(sudo) pip install pyNN
```

In order to run network simulations you also need to install NEST or PyNN with an appropriate simulator backend (for example sPyNNaker). See [NEST Docu](http://www.nest-simulator.org/) or [SpiNNaker Docu](https://spinnakermanchester.github.io/) for information on how to install these simulator backends. More detailed information is stated at our doxygen page [here](https://hbp-unibi.github.io/cypress/index.html).

Once the above requirements are fulfilled, simply run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hbp-unibi/cypress
mkdir cypress/build && cd cypress/build
cmake ..
make && make test
```

Example
-------

The recommended way to use cypress is to use CMakes ExternalProject_Add. An example project how to use that can be found at [github](https://github.com/hbp-unibi/cypress_example). This repository should be the starting point for your networks. See below for more details.

However, if you want to use cypress more directly, here is an example how to do that:


```c++
#include <cypress/cypress.hpp>

using namespace cypress;

int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
{
    // Print some usage information
    if (argc != 2) {
        std::cout << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <SIMULATOR>" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Create the network description and run it
    Network net = Network()
        .add_population<SpikeSourceArray>("source", 1, {100.0, 200.0, 300.0})
        .add_population<IfCondExp>("neuron", 4, {}, {"spikes"})
        .add_connection("source", "neuron", Connector::all_to_all(0.16))
        .run(argv[1]);

    // Print the results
    for (auto neuron: net.population<IfCondExp>("neuron")) {
        std::cout << "Spike times for neuron " << neuron.nid() << std::endl;
        std::cout << neuron.signals().get_spikes();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

You can compile this code using the following command line:
```bash
g++ -std=c++14 cypress_test.cpp -o cypress_test -lcypress -lpthread -ldl
```
Then run it with the native NEST backing using
```bash
./cypress_test nest
```
Other backends include `pynn.X` where `X` is the name of a PyNN backend, or
`nmpi.X` or `nmpi.pynn.X` where `X` is the name of a PyNN backend that should
be executed on the NMPI platform. See below for details.

Features
--------

### Consistent API

The API of Cypress is extremely consistent: network description objects exhibit a common
set of methods for setting parameters and performing connections. The following constructs
are all valid:

```c++
Population<IfCondExp> pop(net, 10, IfCondExpParameters().v_rest(-65.0).v_thresh(-40.0));
PopulationView<IfCondExp> view = pop(3, 5);
Neuron<IfCondExp> n1 = view[0]; // Neuron three
Neuron<IfCondExp> n2 = pop[1];

view.connect_to(pop[6], Connector::all_to_all(0.1, 0.1)); // weight, delay
n2.connect_to(view, Connector::all_to_all(0.1, 0.1));
```

### Execute on various simulators

Cypress utilises PyNN to provide a multitude of simulation platforms, including the
digital manycore system SpiNNaker (early codename NM-MC1) developed at the University of Manchester and the
analogue physical model system BrainScaleS (early codename NM-PM1) developed at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics
at Heidelberg University.

### Harness the power of C++

Especially when procedurally constructing large neural networks, Python might be
a major bottleneck. However, constructing networks in C++ is extremely fast. Furthermore,
this amazing alien C++ technology-thingy allows to detect most errors in your code before actually
executing it. Who would have thought of that?

### Graph visualization via dot (Graphviz)
Simply call ``` create_dot(netw, "graph_label")``` to create a simplified visualization of your created network.

### Supported Backends

Currently we support the following backends:
 * `genn` makes use of the Gpu-Enhanced Neuronal Network Simulation environment [GeNN](http://genn-team.github.io/genn/)
 * `pynn.nest` is using the NEST simulator via PyNN (see [nest](http://www.nest-simulator.org/) for installation instructions) 
 * `nest` **experimental** implementation of NEST SLI with reduced set of supported features
 * `spinnaker` uses the digital SpiNNaker architecture via its pyNN interface (see [SpiNNaker](https://spinnakermanchester.github.io/))
 * `nmpm1` is using the BrainScaleS system [BrainScaleS](https://brainscales.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/) and its executable system specification `ESS`
 * `spikey`, the predecessor of BrainScaleS [Spikey](https://www.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/vision/research/spikey/)

Futhermore, backends available through the Neuromorphic Platform Service nmpi can be used via `nmpi.backend`. If you have access to the Heidelberg server environment, jobs can be executed from the entry server or one of the computation nodes by using `slurm.x`, with which resources are automatically allocated. 
To parallelize simulators, `json.x` serializes a network to json and executes an independent process with simulator `x`, reading the network infrastructure from the generate json. 

Backend specific performance and setup knobs
------------
There are several optimization knobs you can use to tune the simulation. These can be used by amending the backend string, e.g. ```spinnaker='{"option" : value, "option2" : value2, ...}'```. This is used for backend specific options expected from ```pynn.setup(...)```, but also for some additional options which are listed [here](https://hbp-unibi.github.io/cypress/index.html).


 
Using Cypress in your own project
------------

The easiest way is to set up your project like in this example project [github](https://github.com/hbp-unibi/cypress_example).

For installation of cypress, choose the installation path calling ```cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path> -DSTATIC_LINKING=TRUE``` from your build folder (replacing `<path>` with your installation path). Here, we recommend to install using ```~/.local/``` for installation without sudo. 
Currently, you also need to change the CMakeLists.txt in ```external/pybind11/```. In lines 151/155 disable the if statement (pybind11 issue 1733). A final ```make && make install``` will install the project to your requested location. 

In your subproject, add
```cmake 
find_package(Cypress REQUIRED)
include_directories(${CYPRESS_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```
to your cmake file. All your executables must then be linked to ```${CYPRESS_LIBRARY}```.


FAQ
------------

Q: Executing make && make test (or during simulations) the program aborts with a seg fault.  
A: Try building without static linking (comment line 52 in CMakeLists.txt) ```SET(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -static")```

Q: On SpiNNaker, there is an issue: ```C++ exception with description "KeyError: "Unexpected key type: <type 'unicode'>" ```  
A: Manually patch ```lib/python2.7/site-packages/SpiNNUtilities-1!4.0.1-py2.7.egg/spinn_utilities/ranged/abstract_dict.py ```: replace ```str ``` by ```basestring ``` in line 222
