*Synfire chain example running on the Spikey neuromorphic hardware system*

Cypress is a C++ Spiking Neural Network Simulation Framework. It allows to describe
and execute spiking neural networks on various simulation platforms directly in
C++ code. It provides a wrapper around PyNN, which allows to directly run networks
on the Human Brain Project (HBP) neuromorphic hardware systems. Cypress also allows
to transparently execute the networks remotely on the HBP Neuromorphic Compute Platform,
significantly shortening the time required when performing experiments.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hbp-unibi/cypress.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hbp-unibi/cypress) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-doxygen-blue.svg)](https://hbp-unibi.github.io/cypress/index.html)

Installation
------------

Cypress requires a C++14 compliant compiler such as GCC 4.9 and CMake in version 3.0 (or later). In order to run Cypress applications on the Neuromorphic Compute Platform, they must be statically linked. To this end you should install the `glibc-static` and `libstdc++-static` libraries provided by your distribution. On Fedora you can install these using
```bash
sudo dnf install glibc-static libstdc++-static
```

Furthermore Python in version 2.7 and `pip` must be installed, as well as the PyPi packages `pyNN`, `requests` and `pyminifier`. You can install the latter using
```bash
sudo pip install pyNN requests pyminifier
```

In order to run network simulations you also need to install NEST or PyNN with an appropriate simulator backend (for example sPyNNaker). See http://www.nest-simulator.org/ for information on how to install NEST.

Note that for now building is only tested on Fedora 23 and Debian 8. Patches for other Linux distributions and other platforms are highly welcome.

Once the above requirements are fulfilled, simply run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hbp-sanncs/cypress
mkdir cypress/build && cd cypress/build
cmake ..
make && make test
sudo make install
```

Example
-------

```c++
#include <cypress/cypress.hpp>

using namespace cypress;

int main(int argc, const char *argv[])
{
    // Print some usage information
    if (argc != 2) {
        std::cout << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <SIMULATOR>" << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Create the network description and run it
    Network net = Network()
        .add_population<SpikeSourceArray>("source", 1, {100.0, 200.0, 300.0})
        .add_population<IfCondExp>("neuron", 4, {}, {"spikes"})
        .add_connection("source", "neuron", Connector::all_to_all(0.16))
        .run(argv[1]);

    // Print the results
    for (auto neuron: net.population<IfCondExp>("neuron")) {
        std::cout << "Spike times for neuron " << neuron.nid() << std::endl;
        std::cout << neuron.signals().get_spikes();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

You can compile this code using the following command line:
```bash
g++ -std=c++14 cypress_test.cpp -o cypress_test -lcypress -lpthread
```
Then run it with the native NEST backing using
```bash
./cypress_test nest
```
Other backends include `pynn.X` where `X` is the name of a PyNN backend, or
`nmpi.X` or `nmpi.pynn.X` where `X` is the name of a PyNN backend that should
be executed on the NMPI platform.

Features
--------

### Consistent API

The API of Cypress is extremely consistent: network description objects exhibit a common
set of methods for setting parameters and performing connections. The following constructs
are all valid:

```c++
Population<IfCondExp> pop(net, 10, IfCondExpParameters().v_rest(-65.0).v_thresh(-40.0));
PopulationView<IfCondExp> view = pop(3, 5);
Neuron<IfCondExp> n1 = view[0]; // Neuron three
Neuron<IfCondExp> n2 = pop[1];

view.connect_to(pop[6], Connector::all_to_all(0.1, 0.1)); // weight, delay
n2.connect_to(view, Connector::all_to_all(0.1, 0.1));
```

### Execute on various simulators

Cypress utilises PyNN to provide a multitude of simulation platforms, including the
digital manycore system NM-MC1 developed at the University of Manchester and the
analogue physical model system NM-PM1 developed at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics
at Heidelberg University.

### Harness the power of C++

Especially when procedurally constructing large neural networks, Python might be
a major bottleneck. However, constructing networks in C++ is extremely fast. Furthermore,
this amazing alien C++ technology-thingy allows to detect most errors in your code before actually
executing it. Who would have thought of that?

FAQ
------------

Q: Executing make && make test (or during simulations) the program aborts with a seg fault.
A: Try building without static linking (comment line 52 in CMakeLists.txt) ```SET(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -static")```
